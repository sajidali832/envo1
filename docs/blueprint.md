- Background color: Very light teal (#f0fafa), a desaturated and light tone that evokes trust and clarity.

- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines, providing a geometric and fashionable aesthetic. 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text, ensuring readability and a modern feel.
- Modern and simple icons representing each section within the app: dashboard, payments, referrals, profile settings, etc.

- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user engagement (e.g., loading spinners, confirmation messages).
